    "question": "Hey there and thanks for participating! For your chance to win a 150€ Amazon voucher and – if you wish – to get your personal physical activity and mood overview, we ask you to answer some questions via the app Telegram each evening for the coming six weeks, with a follow-up week one month after the main part of the study. The questions will mainly be about your physical activity and your use (or non-use) of Pokémon GO. All in all, you will be chatting with our chatbot for less than an hour and you can always e-mail us if you need additional support. Please know that your participation is voluntary and that you can decide to stop anytime by just sending us a message that says `stop´ in the Telegram chat. We also promise not to pass your personal information to others. We will only use your data for scientific purposes and if we use them in a publication, this will only be in aggregated form. This means that we only look at what happens in the whole group and not at what a single person answers. The only exception will be if you ask us to give you a personal physical activity and mood overview at the end of the study – then we will prepare a graph with only your data in it and send it to you (and no one else). To participate, you must be at least 18 years old. If you have any questions, please feel free to send an e-mail with the subject Pokemon to pokemon@uni-graz.at. Ready to start?",
